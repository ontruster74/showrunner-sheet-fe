# Showrunner Sheet - TTRPG Group Tool

This project serves as the blueprint for a React Web app called Showrunner Sheet--a site that will provide TTRPG groups with a tool and organized framework for planning their characters as a group, instead of as individiuals. The Rails backend repo that serves this project lives here: https://github.com/ontruster74/showrunner-sheet-be
